## Things that I learned
I didn't learn like too much but a problem arose that a button was taking the full width of its parent while I was using flexbox on it, after researching a bit and trying out, I found out that it can be solved by using flex-start. So, I solved it.

All in all, it was fun to make and refinef my understanding more.
